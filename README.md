# Job Recommendation System Using Sentence-BERT

This project builds a job recommendation system based on text embeddings using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model from the Sentence Transformers library.

## Features
- Text preprocessing: combining job title, description, and required skills into a single field.
- Generating embeddings for job postings.
- Performing similarity search to find jobs relevant to user queries.

## How to Use
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the notebook `job-matching-with-sentence-bert.ipynb` to explore and perform job search
